# kobeFanPage
Just trying to practice HTML/CSS skills by making a simple fan page for Kobe Bryant

All the HTML is in the index file, images used in the images folder, and a single CSS file in the styles folder. 
Feel free to do whatever you want with it. I have put a disclaimer in the index.html that I have used information from Kobe's 
Wikipedia entry, and I do not intend to profit in any way from this page. Let me know if there are any ways to improve on my
HTML/CSS skills, or new technqiues I should look into. Thanks!
