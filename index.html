		<h2 id="bio">Early Life<h2>
		<img src="images/1996.jpg" alt="Kobe Bryant in high school basketball uniform">
		<p>Bryant was born in Philadelphia,
		the youngest of three children and only son of former NBA player Joe Bryant and Pamela Cox Bryant. 
		He was also the maternal nephew of NBA player John "Chubby" Cox. His parents named him after the 
		famous beef of Kobe, Japan, which they saw on a restaurant menu. His middle name, Bean, was derived 
		from his father's nickname "Jellybean." Bryant's family was Catholic and he had always practiced his faith.</p>

		<p>Bryant started playing basketball when he was aged three, and the Lakers were his favorite team when he was 
		growing up.When Bryant was six, his father retired from the NBA and moved his family to Rieti in Italy to continue 
		playing professional basketball at a lower level. After two years, they moved first to Reggio Calabria, then to 
		Pistoia and Reggio Emilia. Kobe became accustomed to his new lifestyle and learned to speak fluent Italian. He was 
		especially fond of Reggio Emilia, which he considered a loving place and where some of his best childhood memories 
		were made. Bryant began to play basketball seriously while living in Reggio Emilia. Bryant's grandfather would mail 
		him videos of NBA games for Bryant to study. Another source of inspiration was animated European films about sports, 
		from which he learned more about basketball. He also learned to play soccer and his favorite soccer team was 
		A.C. Milan. During summers, Bryant would come back to the United States to play in a basketball summer league.
		When Bryant was thirteen, he and his family moved back to Philadelphia, where he enrolled in eighth grade at Bala 
		Cywynd Middle School.</p>

		<p>Bryant earned national recognition during a spectacular high school career at Lower Merion High School in Ardmore, 
		located in the Philadelphia suburb of Lower Merion. He played on the varsity basketball team as a freshman.
		Bryant became the first freshman in decades to start for Lower Merion's varsity team, but the team finished with a 
		4–20 record. The following three years, the Aces compiled a 77–13 record, with Bryant playing all five 
		positions. During his junior year, he averaged 31.1 points, 10.4 rebounds, 5.2 assists, 3.8 blocks and 2.3 
		steals and was named Pennsylvania Player of the Year while also earning a fourth-team Parade All-American 
		nomination, attracting attention from college recruiters in the process. Duke, Michigan, North Carolina 
		and Villanova were at the top of his list. However, after high schooler Kevin Garnett went in the first round of the 
		1995 NBA draft, Bryant also began contemplating going directly to the pros.</p>

		<p>At Adidas ABCD Camp, Bryant earned the 1995 senior MVP award while playing alongside future NBA teammate Lamar Odom.
		While in high school, then 76ers coach John Lucas invited Bryant to work out and scrimmage with the team, where he 
		played one-on-one with Jerry Stackhouse. In his senior year of high school, Bryant led the Aces to their first state 
		championship in 53 years. During the run, he averaged 30.8 points, 12 rebounds, 6.5 assists, 4 steals, and 3.8 blocked 
		shots in leading the Aces to a 31–3 record. Bryant ended his high school career as Southeastern Pennsylvania's 
		all-time leading scorer at 2,883 points, surpassing both Wilt Chamberlain and Lionel Simmons.</p>

		<p>Bryant received several awards for his outstanding performance during his senior year at Lower Merion. 
		These included being named Naismith High School Player of the Year, Gatorade Men's National Basketball Player of the Year,
		a McDonald's All-American, a first-team Parade All-American and a USA Today All-USA First Team player. Bryant's varsity 
		coach, Greg Downer, commented that he was "a complete player who dominates" and praised his work ethic, even as the 
		team's top player. In 1996, Bryant took R&B singer Brandy to his senior prom. Ultimately, the 17-year-old Bryant made 
		the decision to go directly into the NBA, becoming only the sixth player in NBA history to do so. Bryant's news was met 
		with a lot of publicity at a time when prep-to-pro NBA players were not very common 
		(Garnett being the only exception in 20 years). His basketball skills and SAT score of 1080 would have ensured admission 
		to any college he chose, but he did not officially visit any campuses. In 2012, Bryant was honored as one of 
		the 35 Greatest McDonald's All-Americans.</p>
